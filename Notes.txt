Create an affect layer that combines two different layers by percentage with some amount of blending
	may need to special case 0 and 100 percent to have no blending?

create two renderers: one for high, one for low
each gets its own frame to render to, then both are combined using a masking frame to provide blending
game object is responsible for masking frame to allow it to adjust blending amount
